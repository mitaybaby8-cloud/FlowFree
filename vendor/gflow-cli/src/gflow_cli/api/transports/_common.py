"""Shared constants and helpers for image transport strategies.

Per spec § 5.4, all strategies share: the Flow URL, per-call timeout,
batch_id minting, and response interpretation. Extracted here to avoid
duplication across evaluate_fetch.py, bearer.py, and sapisidhash.py.

Council edit (Claude, 2026-05-11): _FLOW_URL was about to be triplicated
across B.1/B.2/B.3 and interpret_response() duplicated in B.2/B.3.

    :func:`flow_host_kind` answers *which Flow origin*; this answers *whether the
    origin served the app at all*. They are different questions, and conflating them
    is how a sign-in error page and a project editor became indistinguishable —
    `/about`, `/project/<id>` and `/fx/api/auth/signin?error=Callback` all pass a
    host check, so a readiness wait that missed had nothing left to blame but its own
    anchor (#756, #773, the 2026-09-10 RED canary).

    ``None`` means **"nothing recognised"**, never "this is the app". A caller may
    only use a positive answer to REPLACE a diagnosis it was already about to make.
    Never call this ahead of a probe to decide whether to look: a fail-fast that runs
    before the evidence is collected deletes the evidence that would correct it
    (`skills/spike/SKILL.md`), and `page.url` read too early misses Flow's redirect
    entirely, because it is client-side and lands after ``goto`` returns (#639).

    ``"chooser"`` and ``"signin"`` also cover ``accounts.google.com`` — Google's auth
    host, which is not a Flow origin but IS a known place to land. Reaching it mid-run
    is measured, not theoretical (2026-09-10, profile ``denon82``): the session hopped
    there after bootstrap and the labs gallery sweep reported a missing CTA on Google's
    sign-in page. The rejected-browser route keeps returning ``None`` — it has its own
    error and must never read as a missing account or an expired session.

    ``"public"`` is deliberately scoped to the **migrated** host: `/about` was measured
    there (#756) and nowhere else, and the remediation text names `flow.google.com`.
    A `labs.google/about` landing would be a different, unmeasured thing, so it stays
    ``None`` and the caller's own diagnosis stands rather than a message about the
    wrong host.

    Not measured, and so not encoded: whether a NextAuth route can carry a locale
    segment (`/fx/pt/api/auth/...`). `routes.py` shows Flow does that for the app's
    own paths. A non-EN profile would settle it; until then the prefix stays exact,
    exactly as ``internal_chromium`` had it.

      charged to this call's timeout so three attempts stay inside one budget rather than
      tripling it. Measured, with an A/B control, in the spike above.
    * **A reset that outlives the retries is typed.** Unhandled, ``playwright`` raises a
      class that is not a :class:`GFlowError`, which renders as *"Unexpected error … exit 1,
      retryable: False"* — three statements, of which the last two are wrong and the first
      is useless. :class:`NetworkError` is retryable, exits 6, and carries *remediation*,
      which is where the caller says how to get the clip back.

    ``detail`` deliberately carries the exception's **class name only**. Playwright
    concatenates its server-side call log — including the request URL — into the message,
    and a signed URL is a credential: ``detail`` reaches stderr and ``--json`` stdout
    without passing through redaction.

    The status check stays with the caller. Retrying is for a connection that died; a
